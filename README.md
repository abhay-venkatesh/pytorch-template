# pytorch-template
A scalable PyTorch template for any differentiable graph computation project.

I provide an example for the [COCO Stuff Dataset](https://github.com/nightrome/cocostuff). One can imitate this example to implement any project. 

## Setup

Install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) and then run
```bash
conda create env
```
